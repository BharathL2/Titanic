## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster (binary classification). Using the given dataset, we perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following files:
- **train.csv**: Contains features and survival labels for training the model.
- **test.csv**: Contains features to predict survival outcomes.
- **gender_submission.csv**: Sample submission file from Kaggle.

Key features include:
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1, 2, or 3).
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `Fare`: Ticket fare.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

Usage
Running the Analysis:
Open the Jupyter Notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb to view EDA and modeling.

To train the model from scratch:

bash
Copy code
python src/model.py

Submit predictions using the generated submission.csv file.

## Models and Results

### Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

### Key Metrics:

| Metric      | Logistic Regression | Random Forest |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Accuracy    | 80%                 | 85%           |
| F1-Score    | 78%                 | 83%           |

The Random Forest model outperformed Logistic Regression with better accuracy and robustness.

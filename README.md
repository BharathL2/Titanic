## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster (binary classification). Using the given dataset, we perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following files:
- **train.csv**: Contains features and survival labels for training the model.
- **test.csv**: Contains features to predict survival outcomes.
- **gender_submission.csv**: Sample submission file from Kaggle.

Key features include:
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1, 2, or 3).
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `Fare`: Ticket fare.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation.

## Models and Results

### Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

```bash
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier

```bash

### Key Metrics:

| Metric      | Logistic Regression | Random Forest |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Accuracy    | 80%                 | 85%           |
| F1-Score    | 78%                 | 83%           |

The Random Forest model outperformed Logistic Regression with better accuracy and robustness.
